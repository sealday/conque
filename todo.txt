 -- Trivial --

 * fix colors (see Issue)
 x allow pausing mappings so user can edit screen
 x send SIGWNCH on window resize 
 * send entire buffer contents to conque instead of just visual selection
 x add better error message if python is not installed
 * check Bram's <f\e> suggestion for normal mode timer

 -- Impossible --

 * scroll unfocused buffer
 * allow C-w in insert mode (see Issue)
