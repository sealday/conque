 -- Trivial --

 * check Bram's <f\e> suggestion for normal mode timer
 * send entire buffer contents to conque instead of just visual selection
 * temporarily set 'switchbuf' to useopen/tab on <f9>

 -- Non-Trivial --

 * check for resized window upon entering insert mode
 * re-review polling for a method which doesn't require leaving insert mode

 -- Probably Impossible --

 * scroll unfocused buffer

 x fix colors (see Issue)
 x allow pausing mappings so user can edit screen
 x send SIGWNCH on window resize
